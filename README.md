# Git pull
- If you are like me who uses a lot of other person's scripts then keeping all of them updated is a.... well it's a task which I don't like to do so this script is the answer.... pass any directory and let this bad boy do it's work.

---

- Usage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aviksaikat/git-puller.git
cd git-puller
chmod +x git_pull.sh
./git_pull.sh <directory>
```

- Requirements:
- Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install -y lolcat
```
- Arch
```
see this https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat
```
- Snap
```
sudo snap install lolcat-c
```

P.S: If you're using ssh keys for git then this will prompt for your password in case of you'r own repos
